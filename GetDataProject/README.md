# Getting and Cleaning Data

Project for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course on Coursera, done by
Emanuele Di Saverio <emanuele.disaverio at gmail.com>.

This course project analyzes, tidy and summarisez the Samsung accelerometer data in order to prove proficiency in the use of R packages for data manipulation like `dplyr`.

The code is organized as follows:

* `run_analysis.R` is the main script file, which performs all the data manipulation and tidying. It requires the `dplyr` library to be installed in the R environment, and assumes that the Samsung data can be found in the `data` subfoldrr from the root

* `data.zip` is a zip of the Samsung data in raw form, available here for convenience of the reviewer. to perform the analysis, it is required that data from this package is unzipped in the `data` folder

* `output.txt` which is the output of the analysis and data tidying. It is in the format generated by the R function `write.table()`

* `CodeBook.md` the code book file in Markdown format, detailing the various variable and column listed in the summarised data

* `README.md` the current file in Markdown format
